            Hey there! Thanks for visiting my website! To tell you a little about myself (beyond what you'll find on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-m-haider/" class="text-green-500" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>), I was born in Bangladesh, grew up in the Boston area, and currently live in metro Atlanta. Outside of work, my day mostly consists of chasing after my darling rambunctious 17 month old girl. I love to read and write, and exercising and spending time outdoors are my primary sources of nourishment.
        </p>

            I've always loved technology, and am forever grateful that I was able to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-road-software-engineering-samnoon-haider/" target="_blank" class="text-green-500">change careers</a> from pharma project manager to software engineer in 2019. I currently work as a front-end focused dev on an amazing scrum team responsible for building out the <a href="https://www.nfhsnetwork.com/" target="_blank" class="text-green-500">NFHS Network</a> web application.
        </p>

          My business and management background forces me to think a little bit differently than most devs, but I've found it to be a tremendous asset in my role. Feel free to get in touch on LinkedIn or email me!
